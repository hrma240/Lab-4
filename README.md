# Lab-4


Project Summary: 

In this lab the goal was to learn the importance and use of operational amplifiers (Op Amps). The importance of this is to be able to build amplifier and signal conditioning circuits as well as be able to understand the usage of Op Amps such as their benefits and drawbacks. In order to test this, a series of circuits were constructed. The variables that were used and tested included an LM741 Op Amp and a 1kOhm trimmer potentiometer. We used these variables as others, such as a variety of resistors, to create different Inverting Op Amp circuits, voltage follower circuits, integrating Op Amp, and differentiating Op Amp in order to observe the gain in each circuit. These steps and measurements allowed us to better understand these circuits and learn more about Op Amps. 


Conclusion

By the end of this lab, the better understanding of Op Amps was obtained and learned. On top of this the learning about the benefits and drawbacks of Op Amps were also obtained and learned. By using a unity gain, moderate gain, high gain inverting Op Amp circuits, as well as a voltage follower circuit, integrating Op Amp circuit, and differentiating Op Amp circuit we were able to form a better understanding of how gain can change due to resistance, current and voltage that are passing through the differing circuits.
